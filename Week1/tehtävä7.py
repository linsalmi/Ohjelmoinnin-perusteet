#Create a Python program that is able to calculate car’s fuel consumption (diesel or petrol) and present the consumption in liters per 100km “x l per 100 km”

#Print info message “Calculate fuel consumtion.”
print("Calculate fuel consumption.")
#Ask “Enter travel distance(kilometers): ” and store the value to Feed variable
Feed = input("Enter travel distance(kilometers): ")
#Convert the Feed into an integer and assign it to Distance variable
Distance = int(Feed)
#Ask “Enter fuel usage(liters): ”
Feed = input("Enter fuel usage(liters): ")
#Convert the Feed into an integer and assign it to FuelUsage variable
FuelUsage = int(Feed)
#Calculate the Consumption for 100 km
Consumption = (FuelUsage / Distance) * 100
#Convert the Consumption back to an integer
Consumption = int(Consumption)
#Print “Fuel consumption is {Consumption} l per 100 km”
print("Fuel consumption is", Consumption, "l per 100 km")



#Calculate fuel consumption.
#Enter travel distance(kilometers): 200
#Enter fuel usage(liters): 20
#Fuel consumption is 10 l per 100 km
