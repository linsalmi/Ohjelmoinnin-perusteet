# Make a Python program, which prompts user for a car brand and model. 
# After user inputs, do print the car brand and model sentence with two print commands using “sep” and “end” parameters.

# Example program run:

# Program starting.
print("Program starting.")
# Insert car brand: Toyota
Brand = input("Insert car brand: ")
# Insert car model: Corolla
Model = input("Insert car model: ")
# Car brand is "Toyota" and the model is 'Corolla'.
print(f"Car brand is \"{Brand}\" ", end="")
print("and the model is ", f"{Model}'.", sep="'")
# Program ending.
print("Program ending.")
