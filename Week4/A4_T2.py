# Copy the previous program and modify the behaviour 
# to match the example program run below. 
# This program must use “for-loop” structure.

# It is recommended to replace the print-command end character with space, 
# so that all the iterations can be printed on the same row. 
# Last iteration might require additional logic 
# to get rid of the extra space at the end.
