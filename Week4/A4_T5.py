# Make a program, which prompts user to insert three integers:

# 1. Starting point
# 2. Stopping point
# 3. Inspection point

# Test the points with following rules(Note! testing order matters):

# 1. Starting point must be less than stopping point
# "Starting point value must be less than the stopping point value."
# 2. The inspection point must be within the range of the start and stop points.
# "Inspection value must be within the range of start and stop."
# 
# If any rule above is broken, print the violation message(s) to the user 
# and then skip the next part till the "Program ending." print.

# Run two for-loops like shown in the example program runs 
# if none of the rules above are broken. 
# Inside the loops, compare the inspection point to the current iteration. 
# Use break and continue commands 
# if the current iteration is same as the inspection point. 
# Otherwise print the current iteration on the same line.
